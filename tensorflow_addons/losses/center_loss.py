    The loss was designed to develop an effectively improve the discriminative
    power of the deep learned features. In fact, the key is to minimize the
    intra-class variations while keeping the features of different classes
    separable. Usually combining with softmax losss to jointly supervise the
    CNNs to have a better result.
    We expect labels `y_pred` must be the output of the last fully connected
    layer, which is 2-D float `Tensor` of l2 normalized embedding vectors and
    `y_true` to be provided as 1-D integer `Tensor` with shape [batch_size]
    of multi-class integer labels.

    Args:
      name: Optional name for the op.
      reduction: (Optional) Type of `tf.keras.losses.Reduction` to apply to
        loss. Default value is `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`.

    Returns:
